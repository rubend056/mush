# mush — findings: the queue of record

`docs/refactor.md` §6 defers to this file for "what is broken"; that file is the
structural companion and says where a fix *belongs*. This file says what is
wrong, where it was seen, and where it stands.

Status column: ⬜ open · 🔄 being worked · ✅ fixed (and by which home).

Entries marked **live** were observed in a real mush session — the orchestrator
running this very repository — not reasoned about from the source. Those are the
ones worth trusting hardest: the screen and the transcript are the truth.

---

## 1. Observed live: the agent tree lies about who is working

These were seen in the session that produced the M2.75/M2.8 work, while four
subagents and their children ran. They share one cause, and it is R0's cause
again: something on the screen was a stored *conclusion* ("has children",
"busy") rather than a derived fact (`Phase`, and the instant it began).
`docs/refactor.md` §3.1's `AgentTree::busy` was made a method, and the row and
the title now read that one derivation instead of each making their own.

| ID | What | Status | Seen where · closed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| U1 | **A working agent is drawn as paused.** A row renders `⏸` for an agent that is still working, because the glyph comes from "has live children" rather than from the agent's own phase. The orchestrator's four children all showed `⏸` while each was mid-turn — the icon said "waiting" about agents that were busy, which is the exact class of lie §4.5 R0 set out to make impossible. | ✅ | seen in the tree pane, all four rows, whole run — closed by `ui::phase_glyph` (a function of the node's own `Phase` only) with the children as a separate `⏸N` count (`ui::agent_line`) |
| U2 | **The pane title counts waiting agents as working.** The title reads `agents · 6 running · …` while some of those agents are parked waiting on children (and one was stopped). A count is a derived fact like any other: it must be computed from the phases, and it must say what it counts. | ✅ | seen in the agents pane title — closed by `AgentTree::roster` deriving `working`/`waiting` from the phases (`app/tree.rs`), and `ui::agents_title` naming each count |
| U3 | **Scrolling up in a finished agent's transcript is undone by any other agent's news.** While the human reads the scrollback of an agent that has finished, a message from *any* agent still working snaps that pane back to the bottom. The pane's scroll position is a fact about the human's reading, and it is being reset by events that have nothing to do with the agent being read: `app/mod.rs` calls `Chat::scroll_to_bottom()` from seven sites, including the `Message`/`Status`/`Notice` arms of `on_agent`, and `Chat::scroll` is one number for the pane rather than a position owned by the conversation it belongs to. | ✅ | closed by `Chat` keeping a per-conversation `Reading` (`Holding`/`Following`), so only the pane's own agent moves it, and `painted` marking a held window in the title (`scrolled ↑N rows · PgDn`) |
| U4 | **A grandchild is not drawn under its parent, but after everything spawned before it.** The tree keeps `agents` as a `Vec` in spawn order (`AgentTree::agents.push`, `app/tree.rs`), and `ui.rs` only uses `node.depth` to indent: so a depth-2 agent appears below every previously spawned agent, not under the agent that spawned it. The parent link and the depth are both in the node — the *order* is the thing that was never derived. | ✅ | closed by `AgentTree::rows` walking pre-order over the parent links, so a child sits under its parent's subtree |

These four shared one cause, and it is R0's cause again: something on the screen
was a stored *conclusion* ("has children", "busy") rather than a derived fact
(`Phase`, and the instant it began). `docs/refactor.md` §3.1's `AgentTree::busy`
was made a method, and the *row* and the *title* now read that one derivation
instead of each working out its own answer.

## 1.5 Observed live, again by the human using it

| ID | What | Status | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| U5 | **The same fact is on screen three times.** The newest tool call / activity shows in the conversation pane (as the `⚙` line), again at the bottom of the agents pane, and again in the first line of the status bar — one fact, three homes, no reader. §4.5 R2 spent line one on "activity › status › hint"; the activity is already the row's and the transcript's, so line one is repeating what a human can already see, and the three surfaces need to be looked at together rather than one at a time. | ✅ | closed by `App::tree_line` — the bar's line one is the napping-root fact, or an event with no other home, ranked through `chat::Rank` (`ui::bar_line`) |
| U6 | **An agent is a bare number.** Rows read `#2`, and everything else is inferred from a message; nothing names the *task*. A short title per agent, derived from its brief (and a command label for a job), would let the human tell two children apart without opening them — the brief is already in the node and in the transcript's first line. | ✅ | closed by `AgentNode::title` (`app/tree.rs`), derived from the brief on read |
| U7 | **A waiting agent still says `⠏ working…`.** When an orchestrator has ended its turn and is waiting on children (or on a job), the activity row claims work is in flight. It should say so differently from a model call that is actually in flight — the hourglass the human asked for — which is the same derived-facts rule as U1/U2, one surface further down. | ✅ | closed by `Phase::waiting` (`app/tree.rs`) telling a model call from `wait_agents`/`wait_commands`; the row and the foot say which |
| U8 | **A transient notice never leaves.** `· reply cut off at 20480 tokens — asking for smaller steps` and help output sit in the foot forever (until that agent runs again), so a line about *one moment* outlives it and pushes the conversation around. §4.6's per-kind lifetime answered this for failures and command answers; the "said" rank still has only one lifetime. Somebody must decide which notices are news and which are chatter — and repeated identical lines (`· model produced an empty reply` ×N) should collapse rather than repeat. | ✅ | closed by the chatter lifetime in `app/chat.rs` — `clear_notes_for`, `dismiss_said`, `SAID_TTL = 120 s` — and the `Notice.count` collapse |
| U10 | **Walking back up a deep tree costs one keypress per ancestor.** In the agents pane the only vertical moves are `j`/`k`, arrows, `g`/`G`: with twenty children under one parent, getting from a grandchild back to the root is twenty presses, or `g`, which loses the place you were reading. `←` should put the selection on the agent's **parent** (and the natural companion, `→`, on its first child), which is a fact the node already carries (`AgentNode::parent`) and which the painted order (U4) makes meaningful. It needs the same treatment as every other binding: one `Intent` in `app/keys.rs`'s table, the module doc and `--help`'s KEYS prose updated in the same commit, and a test at three levels of depth. | ✅ | closed by `Intent::TreeWalk` on `←`/`→` in `app/keys.rs` (plus `PickerMove(±PAGE)` for a deep picker); pinned at three levels of depth |
| U9 | **The default DeepSeek window/reply cap is far too small.** A real run was cut off at 20480 tokens; for the configuration mush ships, the default should be ~120k tokens (window, and the reply cap where the vendor accepts it) rather than a value that truncates ordinary work. Precedence must not change: a human-stated window still wins, and an endpoint-reported one still overrides the default. | ✅ | closed by `provider::PROVIDERS`' fallback of 120 000 and `Config::reply_cap` (a quarter of the window, floored at 1 024 and capped at 120 000) |
| U11 | **Compaction happens with no visible state anywhere.** The human typed `/compact` and could see no indication that anything was happening: no "folding…" status, no progress, no answer to the only question a frozen pane raises — *may I keep typing?* Three quarters of the shape is already built (`/compact` says one line in the bar; `compact_history` emits `AgentEvent::Status("compacting on request…" / "context nearly full — summarizing…")` and later `AgentEvent::Compact`; §4.6's notice machinery exists), and the gaps are: (1) a `/compact` that arrives **while the actor is running** is *parked* (`state.compact_requested = true`, honoured only at the next message boundary in `agent.rs`) and nothing at all says so — the human waits for a bar line that has already faded; (2) nothing *distinguishes* a fold from an ordinary model call or from waiting on children, at the moment when the model call can take the whole 10-minute deadline (×3 with the transport retry); (3) nothing says whether sending is blocked. It is not: mush never blocks input, the words queue and are answered after the fold — which is exactly the fact the human needs and the screen never states. **And the sharpest form of it, found in the source after the human added "compaction doesn't wake up agents?? … that's odd": an idle fold is work the screen refuses to show at all.** `AgentTree::activity` (`app/tree.rs`) opens with `if !self.is_busy(id) { return; }`, so for an agent at rest the `AgentEvent::Status("compacting on request…")` the actor emits *before* its summarize call is **dropped on the floor**: the agent pays for a real blocking request (up to the 10-minute deadline, ×3 with the transport retry) while its row still reads `·`/`✓`/`✗` and every derived surface says "at rest". Only the *after* line (`context compacted — continuing from a summary`) ever appears. The one setter that could move the agent refuses to move an agent that is not already busy — and the idle fold's cancel flag is minted locally (`AtomicBool::new(false)` inside `compact_now`), so nothing can cancel it either. | ⬜ | `agent.rs` (state on *accept* as well as on start, and one label a phase can derive), `app/tree.rs` (`Phase`/`Phase::compacting()` so no surface re-derives), `ui.rs` (glyph + the row/bar/foot line), `App` (the "you can keep typing; it is answered after the fold" sentence) |

## 2. Observed live: a delivered completion is invisible, and can be delivered twice

| ID | What | Status | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| B20 | **A child's completion reaches the model but not the screen, and can be folded twice.** `fold_completions` (fixed below) pushes the `#N done: …` line into the actor's `messages` only; no `AgentEvent::Message` is emitted, so the UI's copy of the parent's transcript never shows it. The next idle `Run` then hands the UI transcript back, `absorb` finds no such line in it and re-arms delivery for the same child — so one completion can be folded into the model's transcript a second time. | ✅ | closed by `agent::push_line`, which folds the line into the actor's transcript *and* emits it as `AgentEvent::Message`, and by `absorb` marking whatever completion line an adopted transcript already carries as delivered, so it cannot re-arm |
| B24 | **A failure the model has already read is folded into its transcript again — the whole tree's, at once.** Seen live: the orchestrator finished a run (a tool-free turn), and then mush woke it with a user message holding a *batch* of children's `#N failed: …` lines for agents whose work had already been redone and committed; the orchestrator's answer was "Nothing to re-run — these are the replayed failure notices for work that was already redone and committed". Three facts in the tree allow exactly that. (1) The delivery mark is **cleared** whenever an outcome is recorded again: `note_completion` (`agent.rs:1801`) does `state.delivered.remove(&id)` unconditionally, and the *recording* paths call it — `drain_signals` (`agent.rs:1723`, during a run) and `drain_mailbox` (`agent.rs:1766`, at a boundary) — so a `ChildDone` for an outcome the model has already read re-arms the fold that happens at the boundary. (2) What makes a completion look "already read" on adoption is a **string scan that only knows one of the three outcome shapes**: the `Run` arm looks for `format!("#{id} done:")` (`agent.rs:956`), so a transcript carrying `#N failed: …` or `#N stopped: …` is never recognised as having read that child — which is the very shape a replayed failure has. (3) The marks live only in the live actor's `ActorState`, so a restart loses them entirely while the restored transcript still holds the lines. The rule the code *intends* ("delivered once, folded into the transcript, never twice", `agent.rs:437`) needs an identity per outcome (a run sequence on `ChildDone`) instead of a set that is cleared by re-arrival and re-derived by matching text. | ⬜ | `agent.rs`: `note_completion`/`note_job` (a re-record of the *same* outcome must not clear the mark), `AgentMsg::ChildDone` (carry the run it belongs to), the `Run`-adoption scan (all three shapes), and a test that folds a failure, reads it, and proves a second record of it does not fold again. The "delivered once" the docs already promise (`docs/mush.md`: the napping orchestrator's completion folded as a user message; `CommandDone` "is delivered once, and folds in as `#c2 done: …`") is the contract this row has to make true, not a sentence to edit |

## 2.5 Observed live: steering a subagent is invisible, and may not arrive

Throughout the session above, the root agent steered its four children with
`agent_control {id, action: "message"}` — the "do not spawn any further
subagents" rule, the result of a child whose parent had never learned it
finished, and where to find a finished sibling's commit. The tool answered
`messaged agent #N` every time, and then:

- **No child's transcript contains a single one of them.** Every agent in
  `.mush/session.json` — the four implementers, their children, the read-only
  auditor — holds exactly one user message: its brief. Counts at the time of
  writing: #1 359 messages/1 user, #2 375/1, #3 277/1, #4 425/1, and so on for
  all ten agents.
- **An idle child was not woken by its own.** #4 had finished its run when the
  message reached it; a nudge to an idle actor is supposed to start a run, and
  #4 stayed at rest.

Two readings, and the difference matters:

1. The nudge *was* delivered — folded into the actor's `messages` at its next
   message boundary — and simply never emitted as `AgentEvent::Message`, so the
   UI's copy (which is what `session.json` holds, and what the human reads) has
   no record of it. That is finding B20's shape exactly: the model sees the
   line, the human does not. It also means the human's picture of a subagent's
   conversation is silently missing every word they said to it.
2. The message never left the UI at all, in which case a steering command
   reports success and does nothing.

Either way this is the same class as §1 and §2: the screen keeps a conclusion
("messaged agent #4") where it should keep a fact the human can check. It also
costs the orchestrator its only lever — with no delivery and no visibility,
"steer the running agent" is not a capability, and the honest workaround is to
spawn a fresh agent with the correction folded into its brief (which is what
this session had to do).

| ID | What | Status | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| B22 | **A steering message to a subagent is invisible in that agent's transcript, and an idle target was not woken by it.** `agent_control message` answers success; no child's transcript shows the line. | ✅ | closed by `AgentMsg::Steer` → `push_line` (folded *and* emitted) and its `Fold::Run`, which starts an idle target — the delivery half; what is left is H5's honest reply |

## 2.75 Observed live: a hiccup on the wire kills a whole run

| ID | What | Status | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| B23 | **A transient transport failure ends the run instead of being retried.** Several agents in this session died mid-work with `cannot reach https://api.deepseek.com: Connection reset by peer (os error 104)` — one of them had committed nothing, another was killed by the *harness* process dying around it, and a third lost a run's worth of edits. Every one was a transport hiccup, not a refusal: the endpoint had no opinion about the request. A bounded retry (three attempts with a timeout, backing off) for *transport* failures only — never for a cancellation, a status the endpoint chose, or a body it deliberately sent — would turn "the run is dead and its worktree is half-edited" into "the run paused for a second". Two rules make it honest: Ctrl-C must still abandon a request immediately (the cancel flag is polled between socket slices and must be checked between attempts), and the human must be told (`retrying — connection reset (2/3)`) rather than watching a spinner that looks stuck. | ✅ | closed by `model.rs::retrying` — `RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3` over the `Clock` seam, transport failures only, the cancel flag read before every attempt and between backoff slices, each retry announced in the transcript |

## 3. The contract bug that started this file

| ID | What | Status | Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| B21 | **A parent in a tool-calling chain never heard its child finish.** `ChildDone` was *recorded* by `drain_signals` between tool calls but only *folded* into the transcript on a turn where the model called no tools, so an orchestrator that kept working ran arbitrarily far past its child's completion — contradicting `docs/mush.md` §5.5. Seen live: agent #2 spawned #6; #6 finished its whole task (commit `2ab595c`); #2 made 67 further turns, every one with tool calls, and its transcript still held nothing but its brief. | ✅ | the fold moved to every message boundary (the tool-free turn *and* the gap after a batch's results), validated by an independent negative-checked test (`mush/9`) |

---

## 4. For the next UX/UI review wave

The wave this section was written for has landed: U1–U10 are closed (§1, §1.5) and
§4.5 of `docs/mush.md` was rewritten against the tree. The instruction stands for
the next one: add to this file, do not replace it, and re-photograph the real
screen at §4.5's sizes (`scripts/screen.py`, including `--ask` when an endpoint is
reachable). The one still-unbuilt home to keep in view is
`docs/refactor.md` §6's **B17** — the `Screen` value and the draw sweep that
asserts painted text (Stage 3). B3 is closed: below the floor every key but
`Ctrl-Q` is refused.

## 4.5 Driven end to end: the stories a human tells

A usability pass drove the real binary over a pty through the stories a human
actually tells — isolate a child, read its work with `/diff`, land it with
`/merge`, restart, steer, quit — and reported where the story breaks for a
person in earnest. The `S` rows are that pass. What worked is at the end; do not
re-run it.

| ID | What | Status | Where it breaks |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **After `/merge` (or `/discard`), re-running that agent writes into a worktree nothing can see.** Merge agent #1 (row `· merged mush/1 into HEAD · mush/1 deleted`, `git worktree list` back to the main tree, `git branch` back to `master`), focus it again, ask for one more change: the pane says `⚙ write_file extra.txt` / `wrote extra.txt`, but the file lands in `.mush/wt/1/extra.txt` — a *plain directory* `write_file` recreated at the reclaimed path. `git status` is clean, `git worktree list` lists nothing, `/diff 1` and `/merge 1` say `agent #1 has no worktree branch (not isolated)`, and `/worktrees` says there are none. Every surface denies the file exists, and the work can never be landed. `AgentTree::land` clears the branch (its comment says the new run "happens in the main checkout"); it does not — the node still carries the worktree path, so the next run's file I/O goes back to the dead path. | ⬜ | `app/tree.rs` (`land`/`discard` must clear the worktree path too, so a later run is honestly in the main checkout), `agent.rs`'s file tools (resolve through the node, so a stale path cannot be used), and a test that merges, re-runs, and asserts the file is in the root and `git status` shows it |
| S2 | **`Enter` on an agent row focuses the transcript but not the keyboard — the message you type is eaten.** After `Enter` the pane is `agent #1` and the box prompt reads `#1 ›`, but the bar still says ` agents `: the tree kept the keyboard. Typing `hi again` sends nothing (0 model requests); the tree cursor moved and the visible pane silently switched back to the root — and a stray `c` in the text would have cancelled the agent. Only after a further `Tab` does the nudge reach the child. `README` promises "`Enter` on a row focuses that agent — the chat switches to its transcript and typing nudges it". | ⬜ | `app/keys.rs` / `app/mod.rs` (`focus_cursor_row` must move the keyboard with the focus, or `Intent` must make the tree unable to eat printable keys), the bar's ` chat `/` agents ` badge must agree, and a test that types after `Enter` and asserts the message reached that agent |
| S3 | **A `session.json` mush cannot parse is dropped silently, then overwritten.** A 648-byte session with a long conversation and one agent, if any field does not match the schema (a bisect showed `"status": "failed"` — the real encoding is `{"failed": "…"}` — is enough), comes back as an empty app with the empty-state hint, no warning on screen, no entry in `/notes`. `Session::load` returning `None` is indistinguishable from "there is no session file", and the first save rewrites the file: the old conversation is gone, with no backup. Docs §5.2 promise "Restarting mush brings the session back at rest", and mush is the only writer — so version skew or a hand edit reaches this. | ⬜ | `main.rs` (`load` must distinguish absent from unreadable), `app/mod.rs` (say it: a notice/status naming the file and the problem), and the save path (keep the unreadable file — a `.bak` beside it — instead of overwriting the only copy) |
| S4 | **Ctrl-Q does not kill a foreground `run_command`'s process group.** A root `run_command` of `sleep 10; touch marker` is still alive after mush exits cleanly, and the marker appears 10 s later; a `sleep 40` was resident the moment after quit. Detached *jobs* are killed correctly (the heartbeat job stops at Ctrl-Q). Docs §5.6 rule 2 promise "they die with … mush itself — its process groups are killed on exit". | ⬜ | `agent.rs`'s foreground shell path (`run_shell`) and `machine.rs`: a foreground command's process group is not in the job registry, so `Registry::kill_all`/`App::drop` cannot reach it — it must be tracked for the life of the call and killed on quit (this is S4's sibling of `1de2849`, which made it run *once*) |
| S5 | **The docs and README disagree with the keys for stopping agents.** Live: `Ctrl-C` stops the focused agent and the child kept working; `Ctrl-X` stops them all. `mush --help` and `/help` say exactly that; `README.md` says "`Ctrl-C` cancels everything that is running" and has no `Ctrl-X` row; `docs/mush.md` §4's key table says "cancel running agents". A human who learned the keys from the README presses `Ctrl-C` on a runaway tree and one agent keeps burning tokens. | ⬜ | `README.md` and `docs/mush.md` §4 (the doc hand), not code |
| S6 | **`/compact` on a transcript with nothing in it does nothing and says nothing.** Immediately after launch, `/compact` paints the bar's `compacting #0…` and then the untouched empty state forever: 3 s later the same, `/notes` empty, nothing on the wire. After any run the documented refusal does appear (`· nothing to compact — this transcript is already short enough to send whole`), because the guard is `matches!(messages.first(), Some(system))`, which is false for an empty transcript and returns without a word. Docs §3 promise "The refusal is said out loud because a human typed a command — silence there is indistinguishable from a fold that quietly failed". | ⬜ | `agent.rs::compact_history` (the empty case must say the same refusal as the short case) and a test that pins the line for a fresh actor |
| S7 | **In a non-git workspace, `isolated: true` runs in the shared workspace and only the model is told.** In a plain directory, asking for an isolated child puts `iso.txt` in the root, the row has no branch, and the spawn line says nothing; the model's request *did* carry `(isolated unavailable: not a git repository; running in place)`, but no notice reaches the pane, `/notes` or the bar. Two "isolated" siblings would edit the same files while the human believes otherwise. Undocumented either way. | ⬜ | `agent.rs`'s spawn path: emit the same fact as a notice in the parent's pane (the model already gets it), and say it in docs §5.5 |
| S8 | **Four places where the screen or the docs read badly, none of them a lie at the seam.** (i) The commit subject is the brief **truncated at 60 chars with `…`** (`mush #1: create a file iso.txt containing exactly: isolated w…`), so a landed commit's history cannot be matched to the brief verbatim, while docs/README write it as `mush #N: <brief>`. (ii) `/diff` paints only the tail two rows of the diff above a `+N more lines · /notes` row, so no `+`/`-` line is visible until you type `/notes` — "read `/diff 2`" does not, by itself, show the change. (iii) the pane title says `agents · 2 working` where docs §4.5 still say `2 running`. (iv) `scripts/mock_llm.py`'s `TURNS` scenario waits for the phrase "turn limit", which the prompt no longer contains, so that scripted run ends on the loop guard instead; `README` says the ignored tests run through `mock_llm.py` while `docs/mush.md` §10 says no test refers to it. | ⬜ | (i)/(ii) `agent.rs`'s `commit_subject` and `app/mod.rs`'s `paint_diff` (or the docs: decide which is right); (iii) `docs/mush.md` §4.5 (the doc hand); (iv) `scripts/mock_llm.py` + `README.md`/`docs/mush.md` §10 (pick one home for the script's role) |

**The same pass, driven and found sound (do not re-run).** Isolate → commit →
`/diff` → `/merge` on a real repo (`git worktree list` → `.mush/wt/1 [mush/1]`;
one commit whose subject is the brief; `iso.txt | 1 +`; the diff in `/notes`;
merge lands the file, reclaims the worktree and deletes the branch; a second
`/merge`/`/diff` says `was already merged`). Restart: the tree comes back with
its rows at rest, the landed state persists, a leftover worktree is re-registered
and `/worktrees` reports it, `/discard` removes the worktree and branch and keeps
the row. `/diff`'s edges: `no agent #99`, `not isolated`, `±0 — nothing changed`,
a clean no-op merge. `/notes` reads the whole foot (a diff, a refusal, a stored
failure) as a scrollable popup. Restart mid-run: rows at rest, **no replay**, no
phantom file. `/compact`: idle folds into a summary, a request mid-reply parks
and is honoured at the boundary, the automatic fold runs before the next request.
Detached job: `[still running — detached as #c1…]`, one `#c1 done: exit 0 · 6s`
folded in, killed at quit. Scrollback/typing seam: a child finishing while the
root is scrolled back 3 pages with a draft leaves both alone. A detached HEAD
repo: the child gets `mush/1`, `/merge` fast-forwards the detached HEAD. Tree
pane: pre-order nesting, `▼N`/`▲N`, `PgDn`, cursor clamp, `Enter`/`Esc`.

## 5. What made orchestrating mush hard (the harness, seen from inside)

The root agent of the session this file was written in ran a hundred-odd
subagents in parallel worktrees, and drove five review waves and five fix waves
through them. These are the gaps that cost it real work — each one is a fact it
could not get, or a fact that went stale, not a missing feature. `M3` (attach)
and `M6` (per-agent accounting) are the milestones they belong to; the rest are
cheap.

| ID | What | Cost, in this session | Where it belongs |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **No live view of a subagent.** The only window into the tree was `.mush/session.json` (3.7 MB, the *UI's* copy), so "did #2 ever see #6's result?" had to be answered by hand-parsing JSON. That copy cannot show what the actor knows — `delivered`, parked commands — which is the root of `B20`/`B22`. | The session's central diagnostic was archaeology, and the first diagnosis was wrong *because* the file could not say what the actor held. | `M3` (a `mush status`/attach read over a socket); until then `agent_status` should carry each child's branch, whether its worktree is dirty, its last activity, and whether a result is finished-but-unread — and the session file should carry the delivery/parked facts |
| H2 | **A run that was cut off looks exactly like one that finished.** Agents #1 and #2 died when the harness process was SIGTERM'd and #18 died on a transport reset; on screen and in the file they were simply "idle", with no summary and no marker, and their work sat uncommitted until someone went looking. | Two runs' worth of work recovered by hand; four later agents spent their first minutes finishing someone else's tail. | a `CutOff`/`Interrupted` outcome distinct from `Done`/`Failed`/`Stopped`, written to `session.json`, painted on the row, and reported to the parent as "cut off, nothing committed" |
| H3 | **An isolated run's automatic commit says `mush #N: <the whole brief as typed>`.** It saved the biggest branch of the wave from a killed process — and then had to be amended by hand because the subject was an 800-word paragraph. | One commit message rewritten; the auto-commit hides what a merge body then has to explain. | `agent.rs`'s `commit_subject`: a subject from the brief's first line (or the outcome), the brief in the body |
| H4 | **Nothing tells the human that a child finished**; only the parent's transcript hears it (after the fold fix), and the row's mark changing is all the screen says. | A whole review pass answered "did #2 see #6?"; the human asked the same question. | a `Notice` or bar line on `ChildDone` in the *parent's* pane, and a row mark for "result unread" |
| H5 | **Steering was not a capability you could trust.** `agent_control message` answered `messaged agent #N` for four agents, none of whose transcripts held the line, and an idle target was not woken. Fixed on `mush/15` (`AgentMsg::Steer` → `push_line`), but the *reply* still says "messaged" whether or not anything happened. | Four agents worked for an hour without the rule they were sent — including "do not spawn any more subagents". | ✅ delivery (`AgentMsg::Steer` → `push_line`, folded *and* emitted; it is work to answer, so an idle target wakes); left is the honest reply (delivered / parked / undeliverable) |
| H6 | **Timing-sensitive tests in a suite that runs while ten agents build on one box.** `wait_commands_returns_a_jobs_report` failed about half the time under load (a test racing a clock it had told to lie; fixed), and `a_frame_fits_in_a_60fps_budget…` is still load-sensitive. | Every flake costs an agent a retry it cannot tell from a real failure, and a gate that is green "usually" is not a gate. | the `Clock`/`Machine`/`Events` seams exist for this: no test may depend on wall-clock availability, and a budget test should say "on an idle box" or be `#[ignore]`d |
| H7 | **A spawn cannot name its base.** An isolated child branches from its parent's working tree — usually right, occasionally exactly wrong ("start from `master`"), and then merges had to be done by hand. | Merge labour; one branch re-cut. | an optional base (branch or sha) on `spawn_agent`, and mush saying which commit a child started from |
| H8 | **No picture of the machine.** Each parallel worktree pays its own `cargo build`, so with a dozen agents the box is the bottleneck and nothing on screen says so. | Self-imposed serialisation; the same tree compiled many times. | `M2.8`'s registry shows jobs now; the other half is a shared `target/` or an honest warning |
| H9 | **Quitting kills the agents' process groups — including agents mid-task.** Correct per §5.6, and exactly how #1/#2 lost their runs when the harness went down. | Two runs. | a quit that says what it is about to kill, or a detached mode, instead of silence |
| H10 | **Worktrees and branches accumulate and nothing prunes them.** Twenty-two were live at the end, most finished and merged; `/worktrees` also claims "none" while one is on disk (`P10`). | Disk, and two audits that counted the source twice until it was cleaned. | ✅ the `/worktrees` message now counts what is on disk under `.mush/wt` and says how many of those are registered (`App::worktree_report`, finding P10); left is a `mush prune` |
| H11 | **Docs and code drift silently, and the drift *is* a finding.** One wave left `docs/mush.md`'s key table, §4.5's glyphs, §4.6 in full, §8's deadline and §9's milestones stale, plus `docs/refactor.md`'s checklist statuses; every reviewer spent budget on it and one fix wave existed only for sentences the docs asserted. | Repeated re-derivation, and a doc-sync wave owed at the end of every wave. | a status row that must move when a finding closes (or a test that fails when a documented status and the code disagree), and docs updated in the same commit as the code |
| H12 | **Context and reply caps were the quiet bottleneck.** A 20 480 reply cap truncated real work mid-task (`U9`), and several agents burned turns on runaway guards and compaction instead of the task. | Several runs cut off mid-edit. | done for the shipped defaults (`U9`); what is left is per-agent accounting (`M6`, §11.2) so the cost is visible while it is spent |

**What already made it easier, and should not be traded away:** one worktree per
isolated agent with its own branch, and mush committing that worktree's work when
the run ends (it saved the whole `mush/4` milestone from a killed process); the
`ModelClient`/`Machine`/`Clock`/`Events` fakes, which let every fix be tested with
no socket, no subprocess and no sleep; `scripts/screen.py` and `smoke.py`, which
are the only reason a UX review could quote painted rows as evidence;
`docs/refactor.md`'s symbol-level map, which made a 20 000-line tree navigable by
agents with no memory of each other; and this file's one-line-per-defect shape,
which is what let five waves hand work to each other without losing an item.
